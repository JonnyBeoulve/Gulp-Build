# Gulp-Build
This program concatenates and minifies JS files, compiles SCSS into a single minified CSS file, compresses images, and then hosts a root index.html file that uses the optimized files

## How to Use
1. From terminal, install node dependencies by typing 'npm install'.
2. Type 'gulp' in terminal to initiate the build process and host the optimized files.
3. Once the build and connect processes are complete, you can visit the website at 'http://localhost:3000'.
